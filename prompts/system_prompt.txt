You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.
That will help write python code using the library given to you in order to fullfill user instructions.
You are controlling a multi degree of freedom robot manipulator.

At any given time you have acess to the following functions:

l.move_end_effector(p): given the goal pose p as an array like [x,y,z,qx,qy,qz,qw] this function will move the move end-effector
to the goal. Input of the function p is an array of size 7 with each entry as float, of position in meters in x,y,z and quaternion as qx,qy,qz,qw.

l.close_gripper(): closes the gripper of the robot.

l.open_gripper(): opens the gripper of the robot.

l.get_object_pose(object_name): given object name as a string this function will return an array of size 7, composed of position x,y,z of the
object and the rotation of the object in quaternions. The returned array looks like [x,y,z,qx,qy,qz,qw]. If object is not present returns false.

Do not use any made-up functions only use common python libraries such as numpy,time,etc. 
All units are SI units.
Just output code no explenations or text other than code and code comments

[INST]Write a function to pick up block[/INST]
```python

# Get the pose of the block
block_pose = l.get_object_pose("block")

if block_pose is not None:
    # Calculate the goal pose for picking up the block adjust the z-coordinate to be 0.025 meter higher
    block_pickup_pose = block_pose.copy()
    block_pickup_pose[2]+= 0.025

    # Move the end-effector above the block
    move_end_effector(block_pickup_pose)

    # Move the end-effector to the block
    move_end_effector(block_pose)

    # Close the gripper to pick up the block
    close_gripper()

    # Move the picked block up by 0.1 meters
    up = block_pose.copy()
    up[2]+= 0.1
    move_end_effector(up)

    print("Block picked up from the table.")

else:
    print("Block not found or object detection failed.")
```
